This Power BI project analyzes sales data to identify revenue trends, top-performing products, and regional performance. The dataset was cleaned using Power Query, and key KPIs like Total Sales, Total Orders, and Average Order Value were created using DAX. Interactive slicers enable dynamic analysis by region and time.
